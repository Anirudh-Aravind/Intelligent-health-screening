## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- MySQL (local or cloud-based)
- API Key for Groq (for multi-agent AI processing)

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-project.git
cd healthcare-project
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following configurations:
```
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER=your_username
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_DATABASE=healthcare_db
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_generated_fernet_key
```

## Project Structure

### 1. `disease_prediction_model_training.py`
- Generates synthetic medical data
- Trains RandomForest classifier
- Creates probabilistic disease prediction model

### 2. `healthcare_system.py`
- Central orchestration of healthcare screening
- Coordinates model predictions and patient data processing

### 3. `multi_agent.py`
- **Agentic AI Core**: Most innovative component
- Uses Groq's Mixtral 8x7B model
- Implements multi-agent analysis strategy
- Breaks down complex medical data into manageable chunks
- Provides comprehensive medical insights

### 4. `patient_db_operations.py`
- Secure patient data management
- Encrypted database interactions
- Supports patient registration and historical data tracking

### 5. `streamlit_ui.py`
- Interactive web interface
- Enables patient screening and result visualization

## üöÄ Agentic AI Implementation

The multi-agent system is the project's breakthrough innovation:

- **Chunk-based Processing**: Handles large, complex medical datasets
- **Multiple Analysis Chains**:
  - Symptom Analysis
  - Treatment Recommendations
  - Risk Assessment
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Dynamically adjusts analysis based on input context

### Sample Agentic Analysis Workflow
1. Receive patient symptoms
2. Break down data into processable chunks
3. Apply specialized analysis chains
4. Synthesize comprehensive medical insights

## üîß Technological Stack
